XenVif - The XenServer Paravirtual Network Class Driver for Windows
==================================================================

The XenVif package consists of a single device driver:

*    xenvif.sys is a bus driver which attaches to a virtual device created
     by XenBus (see https://github.com/xenserver/win-xenbus) and creates a
     child device for each VIF for XenNet
     (see https://github.com/xenserver/win-xennet) attach to.
     It is also a protocol driver for the netif wire protocol (see
     include\\xen\\io\\netif.h).

Quick Start Guide
=================

Building the driver
-------------------

First you'll need a device driver build environment for Windows 8. For this
you must use:

*   Visual Studio 2012 (Professional or Ultimate)
*   Windows Driver Kit 8

(See http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/hh852365.aspx). You
may find it useful to install VirtualCloneDrive from http://www.slysoft.com
as Visual Studio is generally supplied in ISO form.

Install Visual Studio first (you only need install MFC for C++) and then
the WDK. Set an environment variable called VS to the base of the Visual
Studio Installation (e.g. C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 11.0) and
a variable called KIT to the base of the WDK
(e.g. C:\Program Files\Windows Kits\8.0). Also set an environment variable
called SYMBOL\_SERVER to point at a location where driver symbols can be
stored. This can be local directory e.g. C:\Symbols.

Next you'll need a 3.x version of python (which you can get from
http://www.python.org). Make sure python.exe is somewhere on your default
path.

Now fire up a Command Prompt and navigate to the base of your git repository.
At the prompt type:

    build.py checked

This will create a debug build of the driver. To create a non-debug build
type:

    build.py free

Installing the driver
---------------------

See INSTALL.md

Miscellaneous
=============

For convenience the source repository includes some other scripts:

kdfiles.py
----------

This generates two files called kdfiles32.txt and kdfiles64.txt which can
be used as map files for the .kdfiles WinDBG command.

sdv.py
------

This runs Static Driver Verifier on the source.

clean.py
--------

This removes any files not checked into the repository and not covered by
the .gitignore file.

get_xen_headers.py
------------------

This will import any necessary headers from a given tag of that Xen
repository at git://xenbits.xen.org/xen.git.
